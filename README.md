AutoPrintR
This is an application for automatically printing files either PDF, TXT, DOCX that are copied, saved, edited or moved to a specific folder of your choice. 

How it works?
After first installation when you run the app, you'll be prompted for a "Watch Folder" which will be the folder where you save alll documents to print silently. Every time a document is added to the folder, it automatically gets printed out without needing to go through the printing process.
If you happen to choose a folder with files already; those files will not be printed because only files that have been created or modified from the installation data shall be printed so best choose/create a new folder preferably in your "Documents".
